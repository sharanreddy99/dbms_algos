# DBMS Normalization and Validation Algorithms
This application facilitates the exploration of normalization and validation algorithms, such as All Candidate Keys, BCNF Decomposition, Chase Test, and more. Users can input data and receive step-by-step instructions on algorithm execution, covering aspects like Dependency Preservation, Minimal Cover, and 3NF Synthesis.

# Execution Instructions
1) Goto the project directory and execute the command **docker compose up**
2) Access the webiste at **localhost:80**
